<h1><u>Tinker-DNS</u></h1>

I'm using an Asus Tinker Board with Armbian Lite as a Pi-Hole. It's got a 40mm Noctua 5V fan, and it's actually the reson I started this project just over a year ago.

The .stl files were for the test print of the new corners design, and they've come out better than I was expecting.
